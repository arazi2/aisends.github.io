<h1>NetSec Lab Ver.2023</h1> -->
  <p>
  In the AI-based Sensing, Networking and Data Services (AI-SENDS), we are working on powering sensing, networking, 
  and data-driven actuation network with computational intelligence. The core of our research is developing predictive 
  models for smart AI-powered agents to learn the environment and take actions based on their anticipated consequences. 
  My vision is applied research, and we work with domain researchers from different expertise to leverage the developed
  method in different applications areas. Examples of our research include: (i) developing AI-enabled wireless networking
  protocols for unmanned aerial systems by predicting network topology, user behavior, spectrum mobility, and traffic
  distribution, (ii) developing a safety analysis framework for regular and self-driving cars to extract the overall 
  safety of traffic flow from augmented video and time-stamped crash data, (iii) developing image-based security solutions
  to leverage fabrication variability of nano-resolution optical identifiers for securing supply chains and the Internet 
  of Things, (iv) developing autonomous aerial sensing platform for fire modeling and control, (v) developing networking a
  nd computational nodes for sparse networking.
  These projects involve concepts from information theory, signal processing, big data analysis, Bayesian inference, 
  deep learning, graph theory, digital holography, and dimension reduction techniques.
  These projects are supported by NSF, US Airforce Research Laboratory, USDA, and Arizona Commerce Authority.

<h1> FLAME 2 Wildfire Dataset </h1>
<!-- This work presents a methodology for identifying and mapping fire and smoke using high temporal 
and spatial-resolution observations from an integrated two sensor (mid-wave IR and visible bands) 
UAS-based imaging system. The paper also presents a unique dataset of side-by-side RGB/IR imagery 
collected during a prescribed fire near Flagstaff, Arizona in 2021 [20]. The images are jointly 
labeled by two human experts with fire/no-fire and smoke/no-smoke1 labels. In additional to aerial 
images, data on weather information, and georeferenced pre-burn point cloud data points are included 
in the dataset. It is expected that the methods developed to produce the FLAME2 dataset and others 
to follow can facilitate fire detection and modeling, as well as fire management.

<h1> DH-GAN </h1>
<!-- In this work, we propose a new DL architecture based on generative adversarial networks that uses
a discriminative network for realizing a semantic measure for reconstruction quality while using
a generative network as a function approximator to model the inverse of hologram formation. We
impose smoothness on the background part of the recovered image using a progressive masking
module powered by simulated annealing to enhance the reconstruction quality. The proposed method
is one of its kind that exhibits high transferability to similar samples, which facilitates its fast
deployment in time-sensitive applications without the need for retraining the network -->

<h1> Deep Learning-TSA </h1>
<!-- This paper explores deep learning (DL) methods that are used or have the potential to be used for 
traffic video analysis, emphasising driving safety for both autonomous vehicles and human-operated 
vehicles. A typical processing pipeline is presented, which can be used to understand and interpret
traffic videos by extracting operational safety metrics and providing general hints and guidelines 
to improve traffic safety. This processing framework includes several steps, including video 
enhancement, video stabilisation, semantic and incident segmentation, object detection and 
classification, trajectory extraction, speed estimation, event analysis, modelling, and anomaly 
detection. The main goal is to guide traffic analysts to develop their own custom-built processing 
frameworks by selecting the best choices for each step and offering new designs for the lacking 
modules by providing a comparative analysis of the most successful conventional and DL-based 
algorithms proposed for each step. -->

This is the front page of a website that is powered by the [academicpages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) and hosted on GitHub pages. [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com) is a free service in which websites are built and hosted from code and data stored in a GitHub repository, automatically updating when a new commit is made to the respository. This template was forked from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) created by Michael Rose, and then extended to support the kinds of content that academics have: publications, talks, teaching, a portfolio, blog posts, and a dynamically-generated CV. You can fork [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) right now, modify the configuration and markdown files, add your own PDFs and other content, and have your own site for free, with no ads! An older version of this template powers my own personal website at [stuartgeiger.com](http://stuartgeiger.com), which uses [this Github repository](https://github.com/staeiou/staeiou.github.io).

A data-driven personal website
======
Like many other Jekyll-based GitHub Pages templates, academicpages makes you separate the website's content from its form. The content & metadata of your website are in structured markdown files, while various other files constitute the theme, specifying how to transform that content & metadata into HTML pages. You keep these various markdown (.md), YAML (.yml), HTML, and CSS files in a public GitHub repository. Each time you commit and push an update to the repository, the [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) service creates static HTML pages based on these files, which are hosted on GitHub's servers free of charge.

Many of the features of dynamic content management systems (like Wordpress) can be achieved in this fashion, using a fraction of the computational resources and with far less vulnerability to hacking and DDoSing. You can also modify the theme to your heart's content without touching the content of your site. If you get to a point where you've broken something in Jekyll/HTML/CSS beyond repair, your markdown files describing your talks, publications, etc. are safe. You can rollback the changes or even delete the repository and start over -- just be sure to save the markdown files! Finally, you can also write scripts that process the structured data on the site, such as [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb) that analyzes metadata in pages about talks to display [a map of every location you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html).

Getting started
======
1. Register a GitHub account if you don't have one and confirm your e-mail (required!)
1. Fork [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) by clicking the "fork" button in the top right. 
1. Go to the repository's settings (rightmost item in the tabs that start with "Code", should be below "Unwatch"). Rename the repository "[your GitHub username].github.io", which will also be your website's URL.
1. Set site-wide configuration and create content & metadata (see below -- also see [this set of diffs](http://archive.is/3TPas) showing what files were changed to set up [an example site](https://getorg-testacct.github.io) for a user with the username "getorg-testacct")
1. Upload any files (like PDFs, .zip files, etc.) to the files/ directory. They will appear at https://[your GitHub username].github.io/files/example.pdf.  
1. Check status by going to the repository settings, in the "GitHub pages" section

Site-wide configuration
------
The main configuration file for the site is in the base directory in [_config.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_config.yml), which defines the content in the sidebars and other site-wide features. You will need to replace the default variables with ones about yourself and your site's github repository. The configuration file for the top menu is in [_data/navigation.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_data/navigation.yml). For example, if you don't have a portfolio or blog posts, you can remove those items from that navigation.yml file to remove them from the header. 

Create content & metadata
------
For site content, there is one markdown file for each type of content, which are stored in directories like _publications, _talks, _posts, _teaching, or _pages. For example, each talk is a markdown file in the [_talks directory](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/_talks). At the top of each markdown file is structured data in YAML about the talk, which the theme will parse to do lots of cool stuff. The same structured data about a talk is used to generate the list of talks on the [Talks page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks), each [individual page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks/2012-03-01-talk-1) for specific talks, the talks section for the [CV page](https://academicpages.github.io/cv), and the [map of places you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html) (if you run this [python file](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.py) or [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb), which creates the HTML for the map based on the contents of the _talks directory).

**Markdown generator**

I have also created [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual markdown files that will be properly formatted for the academicpages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.

How to edit your site's GitHub repository
------
Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons.

For more info
------
More info about configuring academicpages can be found in [the guide](https://academicpages.github.io/markdown/). The [guides for the Minimal Mistakes theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/configuration/) (which this theme was forked from) might also be helpful.
