  <h1> PilotPC: Proactive Inverse Learning of Network Topology for Predictive Communication among Unmanned Vehicles </h1>
  <h3>  The use of Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) has become commonplace in many applications nowadays. Like many other technologies, 
    UAVs brings comfort and efficiency to the current practice in many applications while posing threats and safety issues. 
    This project advances the frontier of science in developing safer and more reliable aerial monitoring platforms while offering privacy and safety. 
    Towards this goal, this project aims to make accurate predictions in a network of unmanned aerial vehicles, by using inverse learning techniques, so as to enable safer and more efficient operations. 
     A smart observation system will be developed to constantly monitor the behavior of autonomous agents to identify suspicious activities
    by measuring their deviation from the most rational behavior under given conditions. The proposed research includes several steps: 
    (i) to develop mechanisms to simulate the target node's perception of its surrounding environment (i.e., seeing the word from the target's eyes) using deep learning methods, 
    (ii) to predict its rational behavior(s) under given conditions and available resources by modeling the target's decision making procedure through inverse learning (reading the target's brain), 
    and (iii) to measure the level of trust by detecting rare but critical episodes of deviating from its expected rational behavior.
    In particular, the mobility of UAVs and their networking activities will be investigated as two important scenarios of malicious activities. 
    This project is expected to result in developing new tools and algorithms for the action analysis of smart nodes that will be shared with the research community. </h3>

<h1> FLAME 2 Wildfire Dataset </h1>
<h3>This work presents a methodology for identifying and mapping fire and smoke using high-temporal 
and spatial-resolution observations from an integrated two sensor (mid-wave IR and visible bands) 
UAS-based imaging system. The paper also presents a unique dataset of side-by-side RGB/IR imagery 
collected during a prescribed fire near Flagstaff, Arizona in 2021 [20]. The images are jointly 
labeled by two human experts with fire/no-fire and smoke/no-smoke1 labels. In addition to aerial 
images, data on weather information, and georeferenced pre-burn point cloud data points are included 
in the dataset. It is expected that the methods developed to produce the FLAME2 dataset and others 
to follow can facilitate fire detection and modeling, as well as fire management.</h3>

<h1> DH-GAN </h1>
<h3>We propose a new DL architecture based on generative adversarial networks that uses
a discriminative network for realizing a semantic measure for reconstruction quality while using
a generative network as a function approximator to model the inverse of hologram formation. We
impose smoothness on the background part of the recovered image using a progressive masking
module powered by simulated annealing to enhance the reconstruction quality. The proposed method
is one of its kind that exhibits high transferability to similar samples, which facilitates its fast
deployment in time-sensitive applications without the need for retraining the network </h3>

  <h1> Driving Safety Analysis </h1>
  <h3>We are working with Intel, Exponent, Arizona Department of Transportation, 
    ASU, and UA to develop the Institute of Automotive Mobility (IAM) under 
    a project funded by the Arizona Commerce Authority. This project concerns 
    developing learning-based AI platforms to enhance the driving safety of 
    self-driving and human-drive vehicles in the state of Arizona. 
    The overarching goal of this initiative is developing traffic advisory systems,
     traffic system design guidelines, and online warning systems. 
     My team is working on developing a learning-based anomaly detection method 
     by processing network-level motion trajectories and profiling user's 
     normal behaviors and driving style.</h3>

  <h1> Remote Heart Monitoring </h1>
  <h3>In this project, we are working on developing an individualized kit for
      remote monitoring of heart-related vital signals in order to trigger 
      local and remote alarms when a life-threatening abnormality is
      predicted through analyzing the vital signals. The vital signals may 
      include the heart ECG signal, environmental conditions (temperature and humidity),
      light, chemical pollutants, and activity level of a patient. 
      RFID technology is used to identify patients. In training phase, 
      the informative features of the vital signals will be extracted in 
      order to capture the normal pattern of the signals at different states 
      (sleep, wakefulness, physical exercise, ...). The kit will constantly 
      monitor the signals and send it through a wireless channel to a central 
      processing unit for further analysis. The  system will ignite an alarm 
      on the kit and will send an alarm message to the physician if abnormality is detected.</h3>
